Selection sort is one of the many sorting algorithms I learned throughout my journey as a Computer Science major at UH Manoa. Last semester, we were required to write a selection sort algorithm in Java and demonstrate it's example by allowing the user to see how it takes place in the console. The project consisted of creating an array with random values, and sending it to the console, unsorted. After that, the array gets sorted through an algorithm I wrote in Java and displays it out on the console. The user has the option to see another array get sorted through this process.

Selection sort is an algorithm that takes the first value in the array, and compares it to every other value until n-1. Thus, if a value is found that is smaller than the value at i=0, then it will be swapped. The algorithm continues at sets the next key at i=0, where i++ takes place. This keeps occuring until the whole entire array gets sorted.

This experience has taught me that my role as a programmer can be a powerful one in that I can problem solve at my own will. It taught me that there are many different options when it comes to figuring out how to sort arrays with different items. This expanded my knowledge and also furthered myself as a Java developer. I believe that this will help demonstrate my technical ability to create code, especially in work place scenarios when needed. All in all, I am glad that I was able to not only have control of this project, but also thoroughly learn an important sorting algorithm as well.
