summary: Rainbow Retail is the app that I created with other team members for our final ICS 314 Project.
---

Over this last semester, we learned skills using Meteor.js, React.js, and Semantic UI. All of these implement ways in which Javascript, HTML, and CSS can be used within them, and can be used to build a fully functioning web application. Our app was built using these technologies. Our group assigned each other tasks by effectively communicating with everyone, and using Github in order to show our progression. It gave us a glimpse of how to use our own creativity in order to create something that can be used in the real world by others. I am happy that I was able to be apart of this, and think that it also helped myself understand what a real world project might look like.

Our app, called "Rainbow Retail", is an app that allows UH Manoa students to connect with one another in order to buy and sell goods as students come and go from the campus. Our app requires that you create an account, and uses MongoDB to allow users to use the fully functioning application. Once you are logged in, you are taken to the home screen which provides an in depth description of how to use the application. In the navigation bar (or menu), you will find many different buttons that allow you to use our website and connect with other users. The "Categories" page, allows you to select a specific category, and view all items posted by users that fit into that category. The "Post Item" page allows you to post an item, and uses forms to retrieve the information for further use. The "All Items" page allows you to view every item, category-less, and get into contact with the poster if you are interested into the item. 

Overall, this app has allowed myself and others to work effectively in teams, and focus on specific problems to combine in order to create a working web application. I enjoy working with other people, because you can focus on specific problems and learn in depthly about that specific part of the web application. My experience using Meteor and React has been relatively good, in the sense that they are all modern technologies and up to date. It's much easier than hard coding in Javascript, CSS, and HTML, and can help you make something that people would want to use in our day of age. In conclusion, I hope to continue my journey as a programmer, and learn more about React.js and Meteor to build web applications. They allow for much versatility, and have many cool back end features such as MongoDB. I will keep striving to become a better team mate and programmer, and hope one day I will be able to apply this to a real world scenario.
