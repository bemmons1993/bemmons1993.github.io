<h2>What does Ethics mean in Software Engineering?</h2>

Ethics in Software Engineering means to take into account those around us in the field of Technology. It is a way of showing moral understanding and responsibility not only as human beings, but as having an impact on our stakeholders. Having stakeholders who rely on our code indicates that we need to ensure our code functions not only "just to work" but also to the standard which takes into account what happens on the other side. The safety and security of those who are impacted either directly or indirectly by our code shows that we have to ensure measures to protect our users. I believe that privacy is a big deal for us to consider as software engineers, so it is vital to always consider the privacy of those affected by the code which we write.

<h2>A Case Study</h2>

The situation I was able to analyze was the "Privacy" case, which had a negative impact on the privacy of those who were involved in the app. As privacy is a big issue, it continues to grow at the rate of the expansion of software development. "Google Streetview" was launched in 2007, and displayed both street views of public locations as well as aerial views. Complications came about when people's privacy was invaded publicly. Google displayed images of those found at a breach of their privacy. Google was also found collecting personal data and storing it. However, they denied that and it was later found out to be a fraud statement. Eventually, Google was sued and had to pay fines. 

In this case, I found that many of the scenarios created by Google disregarded the ACM Code of Ethics. The first is that Google violated being "Honest and Trustworthy" as they denied not collecting personal data and was later found incorrect. They also violated "Avoiding Harm", since in this case, they seemed to have damaged the reputation of those negatively impacted by their application, as well as caused potential mental health damage.

<h2>My final thoughts</h2>

Overall, I believe that the proper ethical stance to have been taken is that Google should have reacted faster to individual complaints. This is because even though they took some action, the privacy of those in complaint was still violated until they took action. I also believe that Google did not pay enough in fines, since they were sued for only a "fraction of the profit". Google should have taken more responsibility, and owned up to their actions earlier. I would further like to know how Google did not take these into probability when creating the app. All in all, I think that Google violated many Software Engineering Ethics, and should have owned up to them for the sake of the situation, and the future of the ethical duty of the company.
