<h2>Software Engineering</h2>

Taking Software Engineering has allowed myself to become a much better programmer in many ways. I learned that although much of programming requires problem solving and thinking outside the box, we must also empathize with those who are using our applications. Being a programmer does not mean that I am becoming a robot, but I am becoming even more human. When we write programs, people are directly and indirectly affected by our code in different ways. Being able to communicate effictively with anybody, having great progamming skills, and maintaing an ethical perspective as programmer are some of the many ways that Software Engineering has helped me become a better programmer.

<h2>Ethics</h2>

Over this semester, we learned about the result of programming unethically, and how to be more ethical as computer programmers. In programming, there are ethical standards we can follow in order to ensure that our clients are safe when using the programs we write, as well as anybody directly or indirectly affected by our programs. We looked at case studies, where programmers did not follow ethical standards and had a negative impact on themselves, their companies, and consumers using their products. These are situations that we can learn from, and better ourselves for the real world as future programmers, business owners, workers, and consumers of technology. It is vital that we keep our perspective as programmers well maintained, to make sure that anyone who is impacted by our programs in anyway can have a safe, and good experience.

<h2>A User Perspective</h2>

We also learned how to create real world applications, and the advantages of learning new technologies to do so. We learned a framework called Semantic UI, that allows us to easily customize our websites and create a more modern day feel to them. Semantic UI has many cool features such as creating a responsive web page, utilizing the grid system, and even icons that all help us make a better website. It is a way to provide the user of our website with a better experience, and help us achieve our goals as programmers too. It helped me see that programming is not only about us problem solving, but it is about the user who is using it as well.

<h2>In a Nutshell</h2>

Overall, Software Engineering has allowed myself to become a better programmer, as well as a more ethical programmer. It also taught me the skill of communicating, and working in teams. When building programs, we need to be careful as to how it will affect anybody using it. Of course, we should keep in mind that no one wants to use an application that looks like it was built in the 90's, but we should also remember, that people using our programs are people, and can be affected by what we write in many different ways. As we become better programmers, we should also become more aware of the impact our programs will have. Having better ethics will make us be better candidates to work with, when taking into consideration our surroundings. Software Engineering also made myself a more versitle programmer in the sense that I learned a ton of new ways to achieve a goal. With that being said, I mean that, there are many different ways to write a program. Before the class started, I always thought that everything was hard written in HTML and CSS, and all of those cool websites and apps were completely built from scratch. I now feel that I am more capable of building professional applications and websites because of the fact that I was able to learn React.js, Meteor.js, JavaScript (ES6, Underscore), and even more HTML and CSS. I learned that many technologies are built off one another, and freeing yourself from any bias will allow you to learn much more as a programmer. All in all, I am glad to have taken Software Engineering, because I learned how to work with teams, as well as how to create functioning applications while also expanding my knowledge and perspective as a programmer.
