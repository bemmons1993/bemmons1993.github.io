To begin, Covid-19 has abruptly disrupted many of our lives. As college students, we are faced with new challenges, such as online learning and using zoom. Using Zoom for our
online classes has been an interesting experience. It has minimized real life interactions and has placed our dependency to learn into modern day technology. My daily routine
has been affected tremendously as a college student. I was used to getting up, going to school, coming home, and then working on homework if I hadn't already. It seems as if
the pace of life has been slowed down into the hands of our control. Any type of pressure that most students would have to face, such as social pressure, going to school,
has been minimized tremendously. Because of this, many of us have had some daily obligations removed from our schedules. However this hasn't been a one-way ticket 
to relaxation.

Covid-19 has brought upon many new challenges that we all have to face and have not really been well prepared to deal with. Some of this, includes, stocking up food from the grocery store,
to making sure that everyone in our family is doing well. There are in fact many negative consequences to our society as a result of this pandemic, and many of us are 
starting to be left jobless. Covid-19 has impacted many financial situations as well as the economy tremendously. It has taught myself things that I had not known
before about the world. And it has taught me a lot about myself. Before I go into the impact it's had on my perspective on the world, I would like to share a few things that
I have learned about myself! I am starting to find more areas of interest (thanks to learning from outer sources like Pluralsight and YouTube) that I would not have
with all the social distraction going on before. That being said, I have been studying a lot more than I previously had, and have been more motivated to do so (maybe because there
really isn't much else to do). However, I have been more in tune with the news than ever before, and have seen some things in the media that make me wonder about our
faith in humanity. 

From an educational standpoint, Covid has suprisingly had a positive impact on my ability to learn. I find that I can learn from home much easier than at the library, or even
going to class (I guess it's easy to when it feels like you're watching a YouTube video when your supposed to be in class). Covid 19 has turned our whole world of education 
towards the internet, and I wonder what the future of education will be after this pandemic, or when the pandemic slows down. To move forward successfully, I think that we all, (myself included),
need to keep our routines in check to make sure that we stay healthy and fit, while constantly being educated. I have found, that the more I educate in these times, the 
better quality of life and habits I actually implement into my own lifestyle. Therefore, in order to move forward, and keep creating success, I think that especially in this time,
it is very important to keep ourselves educated and implement healthy routines into our lifestyles.

In conclusion, I have found that Covid 19 has caused the World much distress. Covid 19 has disrupted many of our lives in ways where we are faced with new challenges that
we have never dealt with before. As a student, the education system has turned towards the internet and we are all becoming more integrated with modern day technology
than ever before. All of this has made me wonder where the future of education is going. Covid 19 has had a negative impact on the economy already, and I wonder what is going
to happen when it is all close to being over, but it has also made me find things about myself that I didn't know before the pandemic. I have been more motivated to study,
because of a lack of being able to do other things, and have found that I am becoming more engaged intellectually. In order to keep succeeding, I think that constant education
along with taking care of our health is going to be very vital in terms of moving forward in the future. All in all, Covid 19 has had many impacts on us as individuals, and 
as a society, and it is important that we keep progressing ourselves as individuals during this time so that we can all progress together as a society.
