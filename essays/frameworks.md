<h2>Why Frameworks?</h2>

UI Frameworks provide us with many different alternatives to solving problems when creating websites. These alternatives allow us to build fully functional websites without having to build everything completely from scratch (raw css and html). Using the tools that frameworks come with help us create custom websites for businesses and other services. An example, is that we can use grids to create designs that help place things in specific locations on the web page. Along with this, frameworks come with things such as icons, input boxes, buttons, and a lot more. All of these have professionalism already implemented to their modern looks and can easily be enhanced through a simple line of code in css. There are so many things that frameworks have to offer, we should not overlook the generosity of what they have to offer.

Using frameworks has allowed myself to become more creative when building a custom website. This is because everything that is needed to get started building a website is provided using a framework. Using frameworks makes creating websites easier, especially when they need to look a certain way. This can help save us a lot of time as computer programmers, and make building websites more simple. I can’t imagine the stress of having to replicate a website built through a framework using raw html and css.

<h4>Overall</h4>

I would suggest anyone getting into building websites to start looking at UI Frameworks. They help us design, and provide us with many different options when it comes to creating a website. Frameworks also seem to be up to date to help us achieve a more modern look in our websites. Through my experience, frameworks have helped me design web pages that need to look a specific way, and have specific elements added to them. By using grids, containers, and other elements frameworks come with, we can easily achieve a look that we want, and shouldn’t overlook using frameworks at all. All in all, I believe that if you haven’t tried using a framework yet, you should see how many different alternatives they provide, to save yourself some frustration!
